# Liability Account Monitoring for Money Mules - IIT Bombay Case Study

## Introduction

Bank A facilitates the opening of savings accounts through online channels, offering customers a seamless journey from providing details and documentation to KYC and account funding. This online approach eliminates the need for physical branch visits or face-to-face interactions with bank employees, significantly enhancing customer ease and experience.

These mules utilize various social engineering techniques to persuade unsuspecting individuals into transferring money from their bank accounts to accounts opened with Bank A.
